# GraduateAdmissions
Graduate Admissions is all about predicting whether the student will get admission into the school or not .The analysis has been done by exploring the overall structure of the dataset and summary statistics of each variable. Also, analyzed the number of observations, their data type. As the target value is continuous so, I have used Regularized linear Regression( Lasso, Ridge, Enet), Neural Network, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees and Linear Regression to find the results.


The objective is to help students to predict graduate admissions from an Indian Perspective. The target value shows chance of admit in a university for a student. Target variable is “Chance of Admit “.It ranges from 0 to 1.The dataset is inspired by the UCLA Graduate Dataset. The dataset is "Admission_Predict" which is available on Kaggle's website . There are 400 observations of 9 variables. The attributes are  Serial No. , GRE Score, TOEFL Score, University Rating, SOP, LOR, CGPA, Research, Chance of Admit. All the given attributes are numerical. I have dropped the “Serial No.” variable as it is not a useful predictor. Created the factor of “Research” variable as it had binary values.
